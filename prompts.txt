I am a final year student and one company has come for the internship opportunities and they rely heavily on prompt engineering. Now they have given us one assignment to do in 30 minutes and its a project that has to be built from the scratch. i want you to help me with that . task is to create an e commerce website that enables users to explore products view product details, and manage a shopping cart. The site should have a clean and responsive ui, a lightweight backend to handle data operations, and basoc state management for the cart functionality. I need a working website to be done under 30 min. i need to deliver 3 artifacts. one is the technical architecture documentation. 2nd one is the code base. all these i have to push on my github. some of the reocommended tech stacks are for frontend it is React.js and React Router for navigation, backend is node.js wirh express.js and for databaseit is mongodb atlas. we do not have much time so according to the time limit these tech stacks can be changed. these are not mandatory , if there is any ai tool which can be veru helpful then well use that.


give me the steps one by one
